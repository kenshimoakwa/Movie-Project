### Project Title: Predicting Movie Ratings
This analysis attempts to answer the question of what the key factors are in making a good film. We analyze movie rating data using machine learning techniques to identify key factors. The most interesting results were that Running Time (the length of the movie), budget and release year were important factors that lead to high rating scores. These factors may reveal reviewers' interesting biases and indicate to producers the factors making a film.
